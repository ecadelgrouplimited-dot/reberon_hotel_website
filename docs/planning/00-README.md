# Reberon Hotel Suite — Planning Set

Source of truth for *what* we build: [`../Reberon_Hotel_Suite_Module_Feature_Specification.docx`](../Reberon_Hotel_Suite_Module_Feature_Specification.docx) (Ecadel Group, Sept 2026).
This folder is the *how*: architecture, data, API, design, screens, seed data, delivery plan.

When the spec and these documents disagree, the spec wins on **scope**, these documents win on **implementation**. Record every deviation in [`12-decisions-log.md`](12-decisions-log.md).

## One-paragraph summary

One platform, three apps. **`web`** (Next.js) is the Face at `reberonhotel.ug`: fast, mobile-first, every word and photo pulled from the database. **`admin`** (Next.js) is the House at `suite.reberonhotel.ug`: content, inbox, waitlist, and later reservations, desk and housekeeping. **`api`** (NestJS) is the engine behind both, on PostgreSQL and Redis. Nothing a guest reads is hard-coded; the owner and manager edit it in the House, the website revalidates within seconds. We build Movement I (Face) first on a schema that already has room for Movements II–IV and Later.
